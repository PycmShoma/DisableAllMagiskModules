# DisableAllMagiskModules
TWRP script for disabling all installed Magisk modules

## Description
This is a script for installation via TWRP Recovery. If you have Orange Fox Recovery, use the built-in Magisk Manager.
You can do this manually. Create "disable" file on home directory of the module. This script simplifies and automates this process. It will not restore your system if the previous module permanently deleted system files. Please read the description and do Nandroid Backup before installing new unfamiliar modules.
